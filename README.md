# stranger-think-generator

A fun little program I made a while ago. \
I thought the effect from [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3wGYbq6_Mc) was interesting and I wanted to recreate it. \
The rendering is done completely from scratch as I wanted to learn more about 3D-Graphics and Rendering.
Only very basic stuff though, nothing advanced and just basic lines :D

## test
There's no CLI and all values are hard-coded. \
The command will generate an animation with the default pattern:
```sh
dotnet run # output.gif
```
`ffmpeg` is used to combine the individual frames into a gif.
